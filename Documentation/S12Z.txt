Module "CAN1"      (component FreescaleCAN)
   - CAN1_SendFrame -Sends the frame via the CAN device. Using this method the user can send own message to the CAN bus. This 
                method allows to specify CAN buffer number, message ID, data to be sent and frame type 
                (DATA_FRAME/REMOTE_FRAME).
   - CAN1_ReadFrame -Reads a frame from the CAN device. The user is informed about CAN reception through OnFullRxBuffer event 
                or GetStateRX method.

Module "TI1"       (component TimerInt)

Module "EN1"       (component BitIO)
   - EN1_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - EN1_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or a
